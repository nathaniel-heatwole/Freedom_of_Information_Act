SUMMARY

- Station Nightclub fire disaster (2003): illegal pyrotechnics ignited flammable acoustic form (100 deaths)

- Goal: obtain from the ATF an audio recording from the fire (forensically recovered by ATF), and also the video of the fire

- Fire was caused inadequate oversight of federally-licensed fireworks manufactures and suppliers

- ATF is the primary federal agency tasked with keeping these dangerous pyrotechnic devices out of the hands of persons who are not licensed pyrotechnicians and out of venues like the Station Nightclub

- Conceptualizes the disaster using the classic fire triangle (heat, fuel, oxygen), arguing ATF was responsible for the "heat" component 

- Records sought document – uniquely – the depths of the horrors persons can suffer when the special trust placed in those government officials tasked with fire safety and protection is violated

- Release of these records would serve as a stark reminder to all who work in fire safety and protection of the utmost importance of this work

- ATF used the audio to understand the details of this particular fire event, but never for the wider purpose: creating generalizable knowledge to improve fire safety

- Audio contains information about survivability in fire environments and emergency egress behavior (that cannot be gleaned otherwise)

- Provides several direct quotes from the fire safety engineering literature, saying the field does not anticipate ever having data of the type contained on the audio (because no ethical experiment can be conducted to obtain it)

- Overly conservative survivability criteria drain limited economic resources that could be better spent otherwise, while inadequate safety margins expose the public to unacceptable risk

- Puts forth research agenda for using the audio to further enhance public safety

- Tests potentially novel legal theory: whether an HD version of a record (video of the fire) can be obtained if a low-definition version exists publicly (FOIA "public domain" doctrine requires only that the records contain the same information, not that they be identical or of the same quality)

- Proposes privacy test (to be applied in the absence of any public interests supporting release of the records), based on the quantitative privacy thresholds used by federal agencies, and demographic composition of the 100 deaths

- Learning from disasters is very important if that knowledge: 1) helps the victims of the disaster; or 2) prevents additional victims in the future
