- Station Nightclub fire disaster (2003): illegal pyrotechnics ignited flammable acoustic form (100 deaths)

- Goal: obtain from the ATF an audio recording from the fire (forensically recovered by ATF), and the video of the fire

- ATF is the primary federal agency tasked with keeping these dangerous pyrotechnic devices out of the hands of persons who are not licensed pyrotechnicians and out of venues like the Station Nightclub

- Conceptualizes the disaster using the fire triangle (heat/fuel/oxygen), arguing ATF was responsible for the "heat" component, through inadequate oversight of federally-licensed fireworks manufactures and suppliers

- Records sought document – uniquely – the depths of the horrors persons can suffer when the special trust placed in those government officials who are tasked with fire safety and protection is violated

- ATF used the audio to understand the details of this particular fire event, but never for the wider purpose: creating generalizable knowledge that can improve fire safety

- Audio contains information about survivability in fire environments and emergency egress behavior that cannot be gleaned otherwise

- Provides several quotes from the fire safety engineering literature, saying the field does not ever anticipate having data of the type contained on the audio (because no ethical experiment can be conducted to obtain it)

- Puts forth research agenda for using the audio to further enhance public safety

- Tests what may be a novel legal theory: whether a HD version of a record (video of the fire) can be obtained if a low-definition version exists publicly (FOIA "public domain" doctrine requires only that the records contain the same information, not that they be identical or of the same quality)

- Proposes privacy test for this case (to be applied in the complete absence of any public interests supporting release), based on the quantitative privacy thresholds used by federal agencies, and the demographic composition of the 100 deaths
