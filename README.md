SUMMARY

• Serving in research, strategy, advocacy, and project management capacity

• Station Nightclub fire (2003): illicit pyrotechnics ignited flammable acoustic foam (100 deaths)

• Goal: obtain from the ATF an audio recording from the fire (forensically recovered by ATF) and video of the fire

• Wrote document encapsulating public interests supporting release and presenting detailed research agenda (FOIA.pdf)

PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

• Fire was caused by inadequate ATF oversight of federally-licensed fireworks manufactures and suppliers

• ATF is the primary federal agency tasked with keeping these dangerous pyrotechnic devices out of the hands of non-licensed pyrotechnicians and out of venues such as the Station Nightclub

• ATF processes for preventing deliberate misuse of the system by bad actors were either nonexistent or ineffective

• Records sought document (uniquely) the depths of the horrors when the special trust placed in those government officials who are tasked with fire safety and protection is violated

PUBLIC SAFETY

• Audio contains information about survivability in fires and emergency egress behavior (that cannot be gleaned otherwise)

• ATF used the audio to understand the details of this particular fire event, but never for the wider purpose: creating generalizable knowledge to improve fire safety

• Puts forth several direct quotes from the fire safety literature, saying the field does not ever anticipate having data of the type contained on the audio

• Overly conservative survivability criteria drain limited societal economic resources that could be better spent, while inadequate safety margins expose the public to unacceptable risk

OTHER

• Tests potentially novel legal theory: if a HD record (video of the fire) can be obtained if low-definition versions exist publicly (FOIA "public domain" doctrine requires only that the records contain the same information)

• Proposes privacy test based on the quantitative privacy thresholds used by various federal agencies (to be applied in the absence of any public interests supporting release)
